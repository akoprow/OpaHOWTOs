Summary
-------

[Opa](http://opalang.org) is a revolutionary language for web development.

This project will collect a series of simple, self-contained HOWTOs illustrating how to accomplish certain tasks in Opa. Every HOWTO will consist of just a single Opa file, with extensive comments, including `HINT`s and `EXERCISE`s.

List of HOWTOs
--------------

As of today the HOWTOs include:

* [`select.opa`](https://github.com/akoprow/OpaHOWTOs/blob/master/select.opa): How to properly use HTML's SELECT in Opa? (requested by Nathan Frund). [`Run!`](http://howto-select.tutorials.opalang.org).
